How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
It has allowed me to be more creative. Especially with designs. Most of the time we just see our design throughout other ways. But this is nice because we have a graphic. 
What design process did you follow for your project work?
First we decided on the most important part to start is making the 3d objects having them relate to your design. Once you reach that point you need to create a navigation to see the scene better. Once you have every object in the correct spot, you need to add the final touches of the graphics and lights. 
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I think it will help me try to make things look  better visually and put more care into my work. 
How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I think the new way is starting small and going wide, especially toward those objects that need more than one part to put together. 
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
I think once we started putting the skin around our object gave me the hope and see how much we can make something look like the final project. Yeah I did not have the light source yet, but I was able to see how things are going to be turning out. 
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Honestly we could use this to do math problem We could even use something like this to create models for the 
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
